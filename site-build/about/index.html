	<div id="mission-content">
		<p>The Berkeley Program on Entrepreneurship and Democracy in the Middle East will attempt to answer this basic, yet perplexing question, by examining the relationship between private enterprise, equitable growth, and democratic development. Through a series of conferences, seminars, and courses, the Program will seek to produce and promote relevant interdisciplinary research. Based on the results of this research, the Program will devise policies to promote the growth and sustenance of democratic institutions and entrepreneurship in Middle Eastern communities and nations, and devise policies for the developed world vis-a-vis such communities and nations. The initiative will bring together academics and scholars from a variety of disciplines, who have studied past and present developments in Muslim and Middle Eastern communities, with business leaders and government officials, who have experience in the implementation of forward-looking political, social, and economic policies. Terms like the Middle East and Muslim World are imperfect; the Program will focus not only on the Muslims in the Middle East, but also on countries which have predominantly Muslim populations outside of the Middle East and on the important ongoing role of minority non- Muslim populations within the Middle East.</p>

				<h3 class="person-name">Dariush Zahedi<br />Executive Director</h3>
				<p class="person-bio">Dariush Zahedi was born and raised in Iran, where he received his primary and part of his secondary education.  He migrated to the US in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution, and has, since 2001, taught a diverse array of Middle East related courses for the Departments of Political Science, Political Economy, and Peace and Conflict Studies as well as the Boalt Hall School of Law and the Osher Lifeline Learning Institute at UC Berkeley.  He has published two books on Iran, and his articles have appeared in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Harvard Middle Eastern and Islamic Review, and Middle East Policy, among others.  His knowledge of the political economy and business milieu of the Middle East and North Africa, however, is not purely academic.  Dr. Zahedi has worked for a Kuwaiti investment bank in Dubai and Iran’s largest private mining corporation.  In his capacity as a market and political analyst for the investment bank, he traveled widely throughout the region, and became intimately familiar with various sectors of the region’s economies as well as impediments to equitable growth and democratization.  Zahedi has also worked both as a businessman and an academic in Turkey, which has the potential of serving as a source of emulation for the region.  Zahedi gained first hand understanding of the region’s politicized judicial processes in 2003, when he was arrested and imprisoned in Iran, and charged with seeking to undermine the national security of the Islamic republic through espionage.  He represented himself at the revolutionary court, and was subsequently acquitted of all charges.</p>
