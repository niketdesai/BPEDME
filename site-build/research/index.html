	<h2>The Need</h2>
	<h3>SANTA BARBARA • SANTA CRUZ<br />
	215 Moses Hall #2308<br />
	Tel: 510-642-2472 Fax: 510-642-9493<br /></h3>
	<p>The Arab Spring and the Iranian Green Movement draw attention to the sobering fact that none of the Arab League’s twenty-two member states nor Iran is, as yet, a stable, full-fledged, democracy, with a diversified economy. The Middle East’s predominantly Muslim central and south Asian neighbors do not fare better. Contemplation of this situation, in turn, raises an important question that is bound to define the future of the region: How can majority Muslim countries build and sustain open societies, polities, and economies?</p>
	<h2>Mission</h2>
	<p>The Berkeley Program on Entrepreneurship and Democracy in the Middle East will attempt to answer this basic, yet perplexing question, by examining the relationship between private enterprise, equitable growth, and democratic development. Through a series of conferences, seminars, and courses, the Program will seek to produce and promote relevant interdisciplinary research. Based on the results of this research, the Program will devise policies to promote the growth and sustenance of democratic institutions and entrepreneurship in Middle Eastern communities and nations, and devise policies for the developed world vis-a-vis such communities and nations. The initiative will bring together academics and scholars from a variety of disciplines, who have studied past and present developments in Muslim and Middle Eastern communities, with business leaders and government officials, who have experience in the implementation of forward-looking political, social, and economic policies. Terms like the Middle East and Muslim World are imperfect; the Program will focus not only on the Muslims in the Middle East, but also on countries which have predominantly Muslim populations outside of the Middle East and on the important ongoing role of minority non- Muslim populations within the Middle East.</p>
	<h2>Uniqueness</h2>
	<p>Although there are a plethora of Middle East Centers and Islam and Democracy Programs at various American universities, few, if any, focus on the relationship between the promotion of entrepreneurship and democratic sustainability. Yet such an approach has become both timely and indispensable in light of the Arab Spring, which is unlikely to survive, let alone thrive, in the face of continued economic failure and injustice.</p>
	<h2>Why Berkeley?</h2>
	<p>UC Berkeley is among the few institutions of higher learning in the world with the reputation and infrastructure capable of hosting such a program. Berkeley’s world-renowned Business, Public Policy, and Law Schools as well as its top rated Economics, Political Science, Sociology, and History Departments can, in addition to generating intra-campus synergy, attract the best and brightest global theorists and practitioners to analyze the connection between economic diversification, private enterprise development, sustainable and equitable economic growth as well as democratization in the Muslim World. In addition, the large variety of existing interdisciplinary institutes, centers, and programs at UC Berkeley, such as the Institute of International Studies, Lester Center for Entrepreneurship, Institute of Governmental Studies, Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Osher Lifeline Learning Institute, and the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at the School of Engineering, make it an ideal setting for collaborating to identify the cultural, economic, political, international, legal, educational, governance and financial factors capable of fostering and sustaining entrepreneurship and democracy. At the same time, Berkeley’s proximity to Silicon Valley, along with its capacity to draw upon the vast intellectual and financial capital of its faculty members, graduate and undergraduate students, and alumni, endow it with the unique capacity to generate discussions and proffer solutions on the best modes for reversing the democratic and entrepreneurial deficits in the Muslim World.</p>
	<h2>Key Activities</h2>
	<h3>Building a Network</h3>
	<p>The program will host conferences, seminars, and lectures on the historical, theoretical, and empirical aspects of the relationship between Islam, market economics, and democracy.</p>
	<p>Our target audience, with whom we will seek to construct a network, will be composed of the following groups/organizations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Businesses and venture capitalists (American and international) interested in investing in and conducting business with the Muslim World.</li>
		<li>Emerging entrepreneurs in the Middle East and Muslim World.</li>
		<li>American and international scholars, journalists, policymakers, think tanks, and academic institutions interested in democratization and entrepreneurship in the Muslim World.</li>
		<li>American and international business councils with an interest in Islamic countries.</li>
		<li>The World Bank, IMF, and the United Nations Development Program.</li>
		<li>The Global Entrepreneurship Program (a collaboration between the State Department and the US Agency for International Development.</li>
		<li>Cultural Attaches/Ambassadors.</li>
		<li>Young Entrepreneurs Council.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Deliverables</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Courses, conferences, seminars, debates, and lecture series’ on impediments and catalysts to entrepreneurship and democratization in the Muslim World—at the Berkeley campus, as well as in conjunction with and at European universities and various centers of higher learning, corporate headquarters, and governmental agencies throughout the Muslim World. (To be undertaken during and after the program’s second year of operations).</li>
		<li>Creation of social networks on Google, Facebook, and Yahoo (Year 1).</li>
		<li>Publication of op-ed pieces by Program organizers in prominent national and international publications (Year 1).</li>
		<li>Special courses for helping aspiring entrepreneurs and legal professionals from Islamic countries to hone their skills and plans (Year 1).</li>
		<li>Publication of the proceedings of our events in the form of books, booklets, and articles (Year 3).</li>
		<li>Publication of a journal on Islam and Modernization (Year 3).</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Research Agenda</h3>
	<p>We propose to undertake original research on the following topics:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A random survey of the attitudes of Muslims towards the compatibility of Islam and market economics—to be conducted in all populous Islamic countries (above 10 million).</li>
		<li>An in-depth comparative analysis of Islamic countries (as defined by Organization of Islamic Cooperation membership) that have registered high, medium, and low levels of success in promoting the goals of economic and political development—with the aim of attempting to uncover the causes behind their performance.</li>
		<li>Analysis of the various modes of engagement and interaction carried out by developed countries in the 20th and 21st centuries towards the Muslim World, and the practical results of such involvement, to help focus future intent and policy of such developed countries.</li>
		<li>Survey and interview of the 50 most successful Muslim entrepreneurs around the world—with the aim of seeking to uncover the causes, motivations, and justifications for their success.</li>
		<li>Analysis of Islam’s view and effect on business and the effect of cultural factors on entrepreneurship in the Muslim World.</li>
		<li>An analysis of the role that various minorities (Jewish, Armenian, Christian) played historically on commerce in the Muslim World, with the intention of developing strategies to make target countries more inclusive and welcoming to their minority contributors.</li>
		<li>Analysis of the “brain-drain” phenomena, and the development of a 10-20 point implementation plan for the repatriation or re-participation of expatriate communities from the Muslim World.</li>
		<li>Analysis of political and economic causes behind the ability and inability of countries to overcome rentierism and achieve economic diversification.</li>
		<li>Uncovering the prevailing patterns and trends among Islamic countries with the most number of successful female entrepreneurs and business owners.</li>
		<li>A comparative analysis of the linkage between the status of women and entrepreneurship and democracy in Islamic countries.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>A Research Database</h3>
	<p>The Program will develop a database of primary research on socioeconomic and political development in all predominantly Muslim countries, from decolonization to the present. The database will help identify the conditions, domestic and international, that have historically been associated with the expansion and perpetuation of democratic governments, civil rights, and viable, thriving private sectors.</p>
	<h3>Media Outreach</h3>
	<p>In addition to publishing its findings in significant media outlets, the program will facilitate on-line dialogue through the development of an interactive website with blogs, streaming video, and podcasts. The Program will create an interactive Google map on the transformation of Muslim countries with respect to growth in democratic institutions and entrepreneurship.</p>
	<h3>Scholarly Opportunities</h3>
	<p>The program will create an annual challenge—or competition—for the best original research related to stimulating economic and political development, held in conjunction with representatives from the Organization of Islamic Countries. The Program will also provide post-doctoral fellowships and temporary faculty positions for visiting scholars.</p>
